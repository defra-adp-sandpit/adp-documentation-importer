Generate Code Coverage

```bash
pytest tests --cov src  --cov-report html
```

Install our package using:

```bash
python -m pip install .
```

create an ‘editable install’, in which any changes we make to our code are instantly recognised by any codes importing it – this mode can be very useful when developing our code, especially when working on documentation or tests.

```bash
python -m pip install -e .
```



```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
